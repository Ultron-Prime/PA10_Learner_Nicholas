This is the documentation for Nicholas Learner's Proj10 for CS 202-1001 at UNR, due @ midnight, 11-27-19.

The purpose, operation, etc. of this program is very similary to that of the previous project, Project 9.

The purpose of this program is to create (declare), implement, and use (test) templated ArrayStack and NodeStack
objects, within provided specifications.

ArrayStack uses the "m_top"-th element as the top of the stack (i.e., the top is m_container[m_top-1]), while NodeStack
uses the first Node as m_top, in order to properly traverse the NodeStack object when necessary.

All of the tests are listed when the program is run using the Makefile, and much of the code used in proj10.cpp is copied
from my proj9.cpp, with the addition of templating ArrayStack for Datatype objects and doubles, and templating NodeStack
for DataType objects and chars (not strings or C-strings).

If I were to spend more time on the project, I would do what I said I would in the documentation of my Project 9 (add
bounds-checking for testing top() and adding a message to each class' methods), along with expanding the testing of each
Stack using more type of data.
